# Causal Final Project

Repo for files relevant to the final project. All files relevant for the Sesame Street paper are in its labelled folder (just in case we change our mind on the paper we replicate).

NOTE: the census data files are too large to be loaded into GitHub, so the repo does not contain the actualy 'data' directory from the original downloadable project. I just included it in a .gitignore so it doesn't get uploaded to GitHub. Just add the 'data' directory to your local clone of the repo to maintain filepaths, and the .gitignore should make it so that it doesn't get uploaded.
